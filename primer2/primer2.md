# Primer Challenge 2: Playing Card Shuffling simulator

**Challenge:**

Create a NodeJS programme that simulates shuffling and dealing a deck of cards. The programme should:

*   Create a standard 52-card deck.
*   Validate inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges and throw errors for invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive integers, requesting more cards than available).
*   Shuffle the deck.
*   Deal cards to a specified number of players.
*   Output the hands dealt as an array of arrays.

**Example:**

```js
const game = shuffleAndDeal(4, 5);
console.log(game);
[
  ["Ace of Spades", "3 of Clubs", "7 of Diamonds", "Jack of Hearts", "Queen of Spades"],
  ["2 of Diamonds", "5 of Hearts", "6 of Clubs", "9 of Spades", "King of Diamonds"],
  ["4 of Hearts", "8 of Clubs", "10 of Spades", "Jack of Diamonds", "Queen of Clubs"],
  ["Ace of Clubs", "3 of Diamonds", "5 of Spades", "7 of Hearts", "10 of Clubs"]
];
```

### Additional Revisions:

*   Update the program to support shuffling two decks together (104 cards).

### Notes

*   It will be looked upon favourably if you can comment on your shuffling technique and make reference to Big O time complexity in your screen recording.


### Adopt and use good programming standards

* Eliminate or minimise code duplication & any unnecessary redundancy.
* Strive for simplicity in logic and flow.
* Use a consistent naming convention for functions, variables, objects, etc to provide clear contextual value, improved comprehension and quick readability.
* Use appropriate and consistent indentation, logical grouping and spaced blocks within your codebases; adopt tabs or a set number of spaces (ideally tabs) for indenting.
* Use spaces consistently to separate operators and delimiters.
* Be consistent when aligning braces.
* Avoid deep nested conditionals.
* Be mindful of single (long) lines of code containing multiple operations; consider ‘one line one instruction” unless readable.
* Keep variable lifetimes and scope as short and as small as possible.
* Avoid multipurpose functions and variables.
* Minimise forced type conversion, coercion or casting.
* Know and test your code: adopt a personal and rigorous testing strategy.
* Test early and often, fail fast and resolve effectively.
* Ideally the code should speak for itself. Use comments only when necessary.
